### Digital Capability Locator

The [Ausdigital](http://ausdigital.org/) DCL specification is under active development at [GitHub](https://github.com/ausdigital/capability-locator).

The [Testpoint DCL service](https://dcl.testpoint.io/) is a free DCL implementation to facilitate B2B development.

The Testpoint DCL management interface is integrated with the [testpoint IDP](https://idp.testpoint.io) for access control, and the [testpoint DCP](https://dcp.testpoint.io/), however other DCPs can also be used.

### Digital Capability Locator

The [Ausdigital](http://ausdigital.org/) DCL specification is under active development at [GitHub](https://github.com/ausdigital/ausdigital-dcl).

The [Testpoint DCL service](http://testpoint.io/dcl.html) is a free DCL implementation to facilitate B2B development.

The Testpoint DCL management interface is integrated with the [testpoint IDP](http://testpoint.io/idp.html) for access control, and the [testpoint DCP](http://testpoint.io/dcp.html), however other DCPs can also be used.

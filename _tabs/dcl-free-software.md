### Free Software

dcl.testpoint.io is both a free service and a reference implementation of a Digital Capability Locator service (per [DCL-SPEC](http://ausdigital-dcl.readthedocs.io/)).

The reference implementation is Free Open-Source Software (FOSS). Source code is published in [GitHub](https://github.com/test-point/dcl.testpoint.io/), and support is available through the [AusDigital](http://ausdigital.org/) community site.

The implementation is supported by an [automated test suite](https://github.com/test-point/testpoint-dcl) which can be used to verify any DCL implementation. The test suite is also FOSS, and demonstrates client-side code for accessing a DCL.

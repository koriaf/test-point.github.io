### Management API

The full DCL Management API is a work in progress. Please contribute to discussions about Management API design in the [AusDigital](http://ausdigital.org/) community site, especially the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/ausdigital/ausdigital-dcl/issues) to identify your Management API needs.

The dcl.testpoint.io reference implementation (and free service) provides a simplified management interface that is adequate for many testing and development purposes.

To use the simplified management interface:

1. Click the "Login with idp.testpoint.io" link at the top right of the page.
2. Then select the "Update DCP" link at the top right of the page.
3. Then fill in the form and click "submit".

This requires that you log in with ABN credentials that have been configured with the [Testpoint IDP](http://idp.testpoint.io/).

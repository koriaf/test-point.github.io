### Data Fixtures

All australian businesses loaded to this test database

This implementation currently relies on the [Testpoint IDP](https://idp.testpoint.io) for business authentication and access control. Using this service, developers can 'claim' ABNs for exclusive use on the Testpoint DCP site, and manage their own credentials.. A develper's collection of ABN credentials can be used for testing purposes at the Testpoint DCP API.

### Identity Provider


The [testpoint IDP](https://idp.testpoint.io/) provides developer-managed credentials for ABNs, which can be used to access the testpoint [DCP](https://dcp.testpoint.io) and [DCL](https://dcl.testpoint.io/) services.

Authenticate with a GitHub account to claim and manage ABN credentials and register OIDC Relying Parties for your own testing purposes.

### Identity Provider


The [testpoint IDP](http://testpoint.io/idp.html) provides developer-managed credentials for ABNs, which can be used to access the testpoint [DCP](http://testpoint.io/dcp.html) and [DCL](http://testpoint.io/dcl.html) services.

Authenticate with a GitHub account to claim and manage ABN credentials and register OIDC Relying Parties for your own testing purposes.

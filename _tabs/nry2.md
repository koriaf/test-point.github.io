### Work in Progress

The blockchain can be used as a ledger with the ability to prove a message existed. This enables secure-by-design B2B protocols that require less trust to function. This increases efficiency where it reduces the need for expensive and unreliable perimeter security.

AusDigital are developing open standards for blockchain notary services to support B2B protocols. These are under development at [GitHub](https://github.com/ausdigital/ausdigital-nry)

We will release a free nry.testpoint.io service when the spec is more developed.
